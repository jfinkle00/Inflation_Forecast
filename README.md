# ðŸ“ˆ Inflation Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building predictive models to forecast **inflation rates** using a combination of macroeconomic indicators and machine learning techniques.

## Project Goals
- Analyze historical inflation data
- Identify key economic indicators correlated with inflation
- Build and evaluate forecasting models
- Visualize trends and model predictions

## Data Sources
- Inflation rate data (e.g., CPI)
- Economic indicators (e.g., PPI, wages, commodity prices)

## Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with pandas and matplotlib
- Machine Learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Time Series Forecasting (e.g., ARIMA)
- Model Evaluation Metrics (RMSE, MAE, AIC)

## File Structure
- `inflationFC.ipynb`: Main notebook containing data processing, modeling, and visualization steps.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels xgboost
jupyter notebook inflationFC.ipynb
```
Follow the notebook cells sequentially for data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

## Results Summary
- Summary of model performance
- Visualizations of predicted vs actual inflation trends

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more advanced time series models (e.g., LSTM)
- Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation
- Deployment of the model via a dashboard
